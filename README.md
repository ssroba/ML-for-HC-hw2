2nd assignment for Machine Learning for Health Care

This is the second assignment in Machine Learning for Health Care, an Analytics Practicum in Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon. I am in my
first year in the Health Care Policy and Management Master's program, and am taking this as an elective because I think it's interesting
and going to be very important in the future of Health Care.
